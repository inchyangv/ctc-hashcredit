# Local/dev compose for HashCredit (SPV mode).
#
# What you get:
# - db: Postgres (persistent volume)
# - hashcredit-api: FastAPI service (public HTTP)
# - hashcredit-prover: background worker (no public networking)
#
# Notes:
# - This file contains NO secrets. Put them in env files (ignored by git) or export in your shell.
# - For Railway production, prefer Railway Postgres plugin instead of running db as a service.
